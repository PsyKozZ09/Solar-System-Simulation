# Solar-System-Simulation-Solution
Solar system with SFML, for now we can just zoom, dezoom from the sun, see the time. The scale is the real scale of the universe. The size of the planets and the
distance to the sun are the real values.
There are the 8 planets and pluto.
The numbers next to the planet are the distance to the Sun in AU (astronomical unit)

3 bugs: - when we zoom the background moves at a certain point.
        - The button at the upper left is not finished.        
        - The drawing of the orbit is not good for the planet far to the sun.


For the next update: - HUD where we could: -change the time speed.
                                           -create our own planets with the mass, size, position (cursor position).                                           
                                           -select a planet and get infos of the planet.                                           
                                           -select a planet and zoom in.
